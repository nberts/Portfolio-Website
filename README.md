🌐 Personal Portfolio – Nina Bertrand 

This is my personal developer portfolio, built with React (Vite) and deployed on Vercel. The goal of this site is not only to showcase my projects, but also to share a bit about myself — what I’m currently reading, listening to, and working on.

📚 What I Learned 

Building this portfolio involved: 

    OAuth + API authentication flows (Spotify, Literal.club)  
    Securing credentials with environment variables  
    API fetching with React + serverless functions  
    Debugging “fun” errors like invalid_client and CSS breakpoints 🙃  
    Making mobile + desktop layouts that feel smooth and polished

(For the record: it’s way cooler than that!)
